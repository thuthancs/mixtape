This example app shows you exactly how to generate music, poll for results, and stream audio before generation is complete!

### 2. Base URL

All API endpoints are accessible at:

```
https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/v2/external/hackathons/
```

### 3. Authentication

All requests must include your API token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TREEHACKS_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_TREEHACKS_TOKEN` with your API token (emailed to one of your team members / provided at the Suno booth).

## Rate Limits

- **Music generation**: 60 songs per minute per user
- **Stem separation**: 5 requests per minute per user
- **Clip fetching**: 100 requests per minute per user

## Audio Format & Streaming

All generated audio is provided in **MP3 format** with high-quality encoding suitable for streaming and download.

### 🎵 Real-Time Streaming

**One of Suno's coolest features!** You don't have to wait for generation to complete:

1. **Submit generation** → Get back a clip ID
2. **Poll for status** (~30 seconds) → When `status` becomes `"streaming"`, `audio_url` is available
3. **Start playing immediately** → The song streams in real-time as it generates
4. **Keep listening** → Audio continues seamlessly until the full song is complete (~1-2 minutes total)

Perfect for quick feedback and testing during your hackathon demo! 🚀

## Suno API Features for TreeHacks

- ✅ Music generation (simple and custom mode)
- ✅ Cover generation (remake songs in different styles)
- ✅ Stem separation (extract individual vocals/instruments from songs)
- ✅ Real-time generation status updates

    "type": "gen"
  }
}
```

**Credit Cost:** 5 credits per song generation (including covers).

💡 **Note:** Use the `id` to poll the `/clips` endpoint for streaming audio URL and generation progress.

### 2. Get Clips (Check Status & Get Audio URL)

Retrieve the status and results of your generated clips. **This is how you get the audio URL once generation is complete.**

**Endpoint:**

```
GET /clips
```

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                        |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ids`     | string | Yes      | Comma-separated list of clip UUIDs |

**Example Request:**

```
GET /clips?ids=abc-123,def-456,ghi-789
```

**Response (During Generation - Streaming Available!):**
Once status becomes `"streaming"`, the `audio_url` becomes available:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "31f7d8f7-f29a-4931-9695-809236ec31c0",
    "request_id": "53884401-952e-42ca-b878-8ff519e77702",
    "status": "streaming",
    "title": "Test Hack",
    "audio_url": "<https://audiopipe.suno.ai/?item_id=31f7d8f7-f29a-4931-9695-809236ec31c0>",
    "image_url": "<https://cdn1.suno.ai/image_31f7d8f7-f29a-4931-9695-809236ec31c0.jpeg>",
    "created_at": "2025-09-12T22:40:23.627Z",
    "metadata": {
      "tags": "song generation pop upbeat. male vocals, pop",
      "prompt": "[Verse]\\nI wish I had a home\\nMade of starlight..."
    }

]
```

🎵 **Real-time Streaming** - you can start playing the audio immediately when `status` is `"streaming"`! The song will continue to generate and stream in real-time.

**Response (Generation Complete):**
Once `status` is `"complete"`, the `audio_url` will contain the downloadable MP3 link:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "31f7d8f7-f29a-4931-9695-809236ec31c0",
    "request_id": "53884401-952e-42ca-b878-8ff519e77702",
    "status": "complete",
    "title": "Test Hack",
    "audio_url": "<https://cdn1.suno.ai/31f7d8f7-f29a-4931-9695-809236ec31c0.mp3>",
    "image_url": "<https://cdn1.suno.ai/image_31f7d8f7-f29a-4931-9695-809236ec31c0.jpeg>",
    "image_large_url": "<https://cdn1.suno.ai/image_large_31f7d8f7-f29a-4931-9695-809236ec31c0.jpeg>",
    "created_at": "2025-09-12T22:40:23.627Z",
    "metadata": {
      "duration": 173.6,
      "tags": "song generation pop upbeat. male vocals, pop",
      "prompt": "[Verse]\\nI wish I had a home\\nMade of starlight...",
      "gpt_description_prompt": "A test song for TreeHacks music generation\\n\\npop, upbeat",
      "type": "gen"
    }
  }
]
```

**🎵 Getting Your Audio**: Response is an **array** of clip objects.

- **During `"streaming"`**: `audio_url` provides real-time streaming (live generation)
- **During `"complete"`**: `audio_url` provides final downloadable MP3 via CDN
- **Bonus**: `title`, `image_url` (cover art for the song), and `metadata` are populated during streaming too!

### 3. Stem Separation

Split a completed song into 12 individual instrument/vocal tracks. This is great for remixing, analysis, or building creative audio experiences!

**Endpoint:**

```
POST /stem
```

**Request Body:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                         |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `clip_id` | string | Yes      | UUID of a **completed** clip to separate into stems |

**Important:** The clip must have `status: "complete"` before you can run stem separation on it. You cannot stem-separate a clip that is still generating/streaming.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl '<https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/v2/external/hackathons/stem>' \\
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TREEHACKS_TOKEN' \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --data-raw '{
    "clip_id": "e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53"
  }'
```

**Response:**

Returns an array of 12 clip objects, one for each stem:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "3d2b3a3a-052a-4a5d-a4b7-03f166538c23",
    "request_id": "4889a1d2-edb0-4a4c-9c93-95f7ad3cd02b",
    "status": "submitted",
    "title": "My Song - Vocals",
    "created_at": "2026-02-13T19:09:30.262Z",
    "metadata": { "prompt": "", "type": "gen" }
  },
  {
    "id": "7c45dd90-ba45-4915-94d0-5f72d040c9b7",
    "status": "submitted",
    "title": "My Song - Backing Vocals",
    "..."
  }
]
```

**The 12 stems are (in order):**

| #   | Stem               | Description                  |
| --- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | **Vocals**         | Lead vocal track             |
| 2   | **Backing Vocals** | Background/harmony vocals    |
| 3   | **Drums**          | Drum kit and beats           |
| 4   | **Bass**           | Bass guitar/synth bass       |
| 5   | **Guitar**         | Electric and acoustic guitar |
| 6   | **Keyboard**       | Piano, keys, organ           |
| 7   | **Percussion**     | Shakers, tambourine, etc.    |
| 8   | **Strings**        | Orchestral strings           |
| 9   | **Synth**          | Synthesizer sounds           |
| 10  | **FX**             | Sound effects and ambience   |
| 11  | **Brass**          | Trumpet, horn, etc.          |
| 12  | **Woodwinds**      | Flute, clarinet, etc.        |

Each stem's title follows the format: `"Original Song Title - Stem Name"`.

**Polling for Stem Results:**

Use the `/clips` endpoint with all 12 stem IDs to check their status:

```bash
curl '<https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/v2/external/hackathons/clips?ids=STEM_ID_1,STEM_ID_2,.>..,STEM_ID_12' \\
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TREEHACKS_TOKEN'
```

Stems typically take 1-2 minutes to process. Once all stems show `status: "complete"`, each will have its own `audio_url` pointing to that stem's MP3 file.

**Credit Cost:** 25 credits per stem separation request (flat rate for all 12 stems).

## 🔍 Understanding Response Formats

**Generate Endpoint (`/generate`):**

- Returns: **Single clip object** `{ id, request_id, status, created_at, metadata, ... }`
- Purpose: Starts a new generation
- Contains: Basic info + metadata - use the clip ID to poll for audio URL

**Stem Endpoint (`/stem`):**

- Returns: **Array of 12 clip objects** `[{ id, status, title, ... }, ...]`
- Purpose: Separates a completed clip into 12 instrument/vocal stems
- Each clip's `title` indicates which stem it is (e.g., `"Song Title - Vocals"`)
- Poll all 12 IDs via `/clips` to get audio URLs when they complete

**Clips Endpoint (`/clips?ids=...`):**

- Returns: **Array of clip objects** `[{ id, status, audio_url, ... }, ...]`
- Purpose: Check status of existing clips
- Audio URL: Available for **streaming** when `status` is `"streaming"`, final MP3 when `"complete"`

## Status Values

| Status      | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `submitted` | Request received and queued                                              |
| `queued`    | Waiting for processing                                                   |
| `streaming` | Generation in progress - **audio_url** available for real-time streaming |
| `complete`  | Generation finished - **audio_url** has final downloadable MP3           |
| `error`     | Generation failed (check error_type and error_message)                   |

---

## Potential Workflow Example

Here's a complete example using cURL to generate a song and poll for results:

### Step 1: Generate a Song

```bash
curl '<https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/v2/external/hackathons/generate>' \\
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TREEHACKS_TOKEN' \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --data-raw '{
    "topic": "A rock anthem about hackathon innovation",
    "tags": "rock, electric guitar, powerful drums, anthem"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53",
  "request_id": "a9e6129f-2117-457c-933e-e2c710d2906b",
  "status": "submitted",
  "title": "",
  "created_at": "2025-09-12T18:30:00.000Z",
  "metadata": {
    "tags": "rock, electric guitar, powerful drums, anthem",
    "gpt_description_prompt": "A rock anthem about hackathon innovation",
    "type": "gen"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Poll for Results

**Wait 5-10 seconds**, then check the status. Keep polling until `status` becomes `"complete"`:

```bash
curl '<https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/v2/external/hackathons/clips?ids=e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53>' \\
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TREEHACKS_TOKEN'
```

**Response (when polling shows streaming or complete):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53",
    "request_id": "a9e6129f-2117-457c-933e-e2c710d2906b",
    "status": "complete",
    "title": "Innovation Anthem",
    "audio_url": "<https://cdn1.suno.ai/e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53.mp3>",
    "image_url": "<https://cdn1.suno.ai/image_e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53.jpeg>",
    "created_at": "2025-09-12T18:30:00.000Z",
    "metadata": {
      "duration": 180.5,
      "tags": "rock, electric guitar, powerful drums, anthem",
      "prompt": "[Verse]\\nBuild the future with our code...",
      "gpt_description_prompt": "A rock anthem about hackathon innovation",
      "type": "gen"
    }
  }
]
```

🎵 **Start Listening**: When `status` is `"streaming"`, the `audio_url` will be `https://audiopipe.suno.ai/?item_id=...` for real-time streaming. When `"complete"`, it becomes the final CDN MP3 URL!

### Step 3: Stream or Download

**Stream immediately** when `status` is `"streaming"`, or **download the final MP3** when `status` is `"complete"`:

```bash
curl '<https://cdn1.suno.ai/e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53.mp3>' \\
  --output my_treehacks_song.mp3
```

**💡 Pro Tip**: The `audio_url` works in web players and mobile apps! During `"streaming"` it provides real-time playback, and during `"complete"` it's the final downloadable MP3.

### Step 4: Separate into Stems

Once your song is **complete**, you can split it into 12 individual instrument tracks:

```bash
curl '<https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/v2/external/hackathons/stem>' \\
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TREEHACKS_TOKEN' \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --data-raw '{
    "clip_id": "e4ed728b-7033-4d7c-87c2-a0b635791c53"
  }'
```

**Response:** An array of 12 stem clips (Vocals, Backing Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Keyboard, Percussion, Strings, Synth, FX, Brass, Woodwinds). You can poll all 12 IDs via `/clips` until they are `"complete"`, then download each stem's `audio_url`.

---

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

**401 Unauthorized:**

```json
{
  "detail": "Authentication required."
}
```

**403 Forbidden:**

```json
{
  "detail": "Access denied. Not a hackathon participant."
}
```

**429 Rate Limited (Generation):**

```json
{
  "detail": "Hackathon generation rate limit exceeded. Please wait before generating another song."
}
```

**400 Bad Request:**

```json
{
  "detail": "Topic too long. Please keep it under 500 characters."
}
```

### Generation Errors

If a clip fails to generate, check the `metadata.error_type` and `metadata.error_message` fields in the response.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Polling**: Check clip status every 5-10 seconds. Streaming starts in ~20-30 seconds, and song should be complete in ~1-2 minutes!
2. **Rate Limiting**: You can generate up to 60 songs per minute
3. **Error Handling**: Always check status codes and error messages
4. **Topic Length**: Keep topics under 500 characters for best results
5. **Tags**: Use descriptive genres, instruments, and moods rather than artist names
6. **Clip Completion**: Always wait for a clip to be `"complete"` before requesting stem separation
7. **Stem Polling**: When polling for stems, you can pass all 12 stem IDs in a single `/clips` request for efficiency
